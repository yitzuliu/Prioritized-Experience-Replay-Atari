3. Monitor resource usage and adjust parameters accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage
```python
# Check memory statistics
memory_stats = agent.memory.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Cache hit rate: {memory_stats['cache_hit_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Memory usage: {memory_stats['memory_usage']}")

# Force cleanup if needed
agent.memory._check_memory_and_cleanup()
```

### Performance Issues
```python
# Generate performance report
monitor.save_report("performance_report.json")

# Check recommendations
report = monitor.get_performance_report()
for rec in report['recommendations']:
    print(f"{rec['priority']}: {rec['message']}")
```

### Training Stability
```python
# Get training diagnostics
diagnostics = agent.get_training_diagnostics()
print(f"Learning phase: {diagnostics['training_progress']['learning_phase']}")
